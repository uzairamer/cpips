    Suppose that widgets are manufactured in a factory.  Repeated inspections show that <b>$Y2%</b> of the widgets manufactured are good, <b>$Y3%</b> are defective but can be fixed, and <b>$Y4%</b> of the widgets have to be thrown away.  

Suppose that a sample of <b>$n0</b> widgets is taken from the assembly line.  What is the probability that <b>$n1</b> will be good, <b>$n2</b> will be defective but could be fixed, and <b>$n3</b> will have to be thrown away?

  <p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
 
<p>     Let  \( p \) be the multinomial probability;  \(n \) = $n0 be the total number of events</p>
 <p>\( n_1 \) = $n1, \( n_2 \)  = $n2 and  \( n_3 \)  = $n3 be the number of times Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 occur</p>
 <p>\( p_1 \) = $p1, \( p_2 \)= $p2 and \( p_3 \) = $p3 be the probability of Outcome 1, 2 and 3</p>
<p> then \( p  = \frac { n !} {(  n_1 !)(  n_2 !)(  n_3 !)} \) \({ p_1} ^ {n_1} {p_2} ^ {n_2} {p_3} ^ {n_3} \)

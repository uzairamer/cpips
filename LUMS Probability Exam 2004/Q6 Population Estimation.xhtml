There are \(N\) deer in a forest.  We capture <b>$Y2</b> of them, mark them, and then release them again.  Later we capture <b>$Y3</b> and find that <b>$Y4</b> of the <b>$Y3</b> are marked.  Estimate the number of deer in the forest assuming mixing, no change in the number between capture and recapture, size of original captured group large enough to reperesent population

  <p><b>Explanation:</b></p>
  <p>
Mark and recapture is a method commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size. A portion of the population is captured, marked, and released. Later, another portion is captured and the number of marked individuals within the sample is counted. 
  </p>
  
  <p>n = Number of animals marked on the first visit $Y2</p>
  <p>K = Number of animals captured on the second visit $Y3</p>
  <p>k = Number of recaptured animals that were marked $Y4 </p>
  <p>N = Number of animals in the population = K*n/k = $A_0</p>

# Custom Python-evaluated Input Problems

## Introduction

The Open edX platform allows authors to create assessment problems with customized and/or randomized inputs values and answers. Course authors can write Python code to customize these problems. This has a couple of obvious benefits:

1. Students can attempt the same problem multiple times. Because the inputs can be randomized, its harder to get to the right answer by eliminating wrong answers with multiple retries.
2. If several students are taking the same assessment, each of them can give a completely different version of the same problem.

## Why this repo?

This repository is an open source collection of custom pyton-evaluated input problems. Feel free to use them under the MIT license. If you would like to contribute more problems, please fork this repo, add your problems and submit a pull request.
